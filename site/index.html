    <h1>Introduction to Java Programming</h1>

    <p>
      For a few years around ~2008 I was the course lecturer for
      The University of Edinburgh's
      <strong>Introduction to Java Programming</strong> (<dfn><abbr>IJP</abbr></dfn>):
      a Masters-level, intensive 12-week crash-course in object-oriented
      programming with about 70 students per year.
    <p>
      <abbr>IJP</abbr> had a focus on code design and a diverse cohort of
      international students. It was mostly intended for MSc students from
      other subjects (e.g.  Bioinformatics) who hadn't learned programming in
      their undergraduate degrees, but would need it as a skill in their
      postgraduate careers.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time as lecturer I converted the course from a traditional
      lecture-hall experience to one based on pre-recorded screencasts.
      Students watched the screencasts online in their own time and could refer
      back to them as needed, and all of their contact-time with myself and the
      other teaching staff was spent in computer labs working on actual
      programming exercises, instead of sleeping through long lectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a new idea at the time: it was the first time it had been done
      for any course at The University of Edinburgh and I wasn't aware of it
      being done anywhere else either. It later became popular and was called a
      "flipped classroom".
    </p>
    <p>
      <abbr>IJP</abbr> used the Java IDE <a href="https://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ</a>
      and the screencasts were based on chapters from
      <a href="https://www.bluej.org/objects-first/">Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ</a>
      ("the BlueJ book").
    <p>
    <p>
      The University continued to use my screencasts to teach the course for
      several years after I left. No one should use these screencasts to learn
      Java or object-oriented programming today: they're really old. I'm just
      publishing them here for archival purposes.
